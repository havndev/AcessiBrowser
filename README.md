AcessiBrowser is a Chrome Extension built to help people who have Visual deficencies Browse The Web.

It was developed to be presented as the final project in "Interação Pessoa Computador", a curricular unit from my college.

Altough it can still be improved, in its current state it can help people by allowing them to change various elements in a browser, like font,font-size, color, etc.
